Introduction to the subject of Postak Creations:
Over the years I have loved making hemp Jewelry. When I was a little boy, my sister taught me how. It’s one of my fondest memories I have of her. My mom always referred to her as “flower child”. I hope to one day spend time with her again in the Spirit World. I wanted to build this website in remembrance of her. I want to teach other people the simple joy of creating awesome creations like we used to do together!

Postak Creations audience:
Some of mine and my sister’s biggest bonding moments were making awesome creations together! I also kept myself entertained on my lonesome by just weaving away at my next awesome creation. Postak Creations is designed for people of all ages and all skill levels to come and have fun learning, or recreating projects. People can keep themselves entertained, or bond together with some amazing and fun projects. These projects are fun for the whole family!

What the author hopes to accomplish with Postak Creations:
I wanted to build something that will last through the years! A website that will be remembered my many. I have spent time in past days selling my products at farmers markets, but that is not my intention here with Postak Creations. I just want to show people how to make things. Its possible that in the future I may add a few advertisements to Postak Creations if it gets enough traffic. I’ve even thought about throwing in a link to an art supply website or two. I’ve even thought about drop shipping art supplies, so that Postak Creations groupies have somewhere they can go quickly to get what they need and follow along with the tutorials.

The design and development process: 
When I set out to design Postak Creations, I did give it quite a bit of thought. I had a pretty good idea of what I would need to build in order to fulfil the purpose of Postak Creations. It does look and feel pretty similar to the original wireframe design. I knew I needed a home page, a page about tying knots and a page about making beads. I also knew I needed a contact page to complete the look and feel of the website. I knew I needed to get my slideshows working for the tutorials. I knew I needed navigation not just in the navigation bar, but on the main page in order to be user friendly. I put a lot more hours into this project than the class called out for. I spent many hours a day just trying to get the look and feel to come out just right. I learned some basics of JavaScript in order to solve some of the major issues I was having early on with the site, including making multiple slideshows, having a parallax scroll across all pages, and having a sticky navigation bar.  I spent over a week just putting together the content for the tutorials alone.  I spent so much extra time on Postak Creations because this wasn’t just a school assignment to me. This was an inspiration. 

What the author learned from having built Postak Creations:
What I learned from Postak Creations has been long overdue! I’ve been interested in learning to code for a long time! I’ve just kept pushing it off and pushing it off. But now I finally learned the basics of html and CSS! And I am excited to move forward and learn other skills. So many things in my life just seem to have been pointing me in this direction. I’ve learned the proper steps of designing a website and how to put it on the internet. I’ve always had an artistic eye, so I had fun creating some of the pictures and logos! I’ve learned the amount of time it takes to create a website, although I will probably get faster at it as time goes on. The sky is now my limit!

 How the author will use these skills in the future: 
I know I’ve just started, but I already have about 20 different website ideas that I want to create! My first priority is building up my portfolio website so that other people can see what I can do. Who knows, it might lead me to my dream job one day. I want to be a website designer! I also want to get into web applications in the future. I have many projects and ideas from my younger years that I could solve with simply building a website or a web app. My mom is also an author, so one of my website ideas is to build her a website for her books! 

Conclusion:
In conclusion, I just want to thank you for your time and the effort it has taken you to teach me and everyone else how to do this. Just know that this class, for me, has been an inspiration followed and a major achievement. Whether I get a good grade or not, what I am taking away from this class is life altering for me. Thank you!
